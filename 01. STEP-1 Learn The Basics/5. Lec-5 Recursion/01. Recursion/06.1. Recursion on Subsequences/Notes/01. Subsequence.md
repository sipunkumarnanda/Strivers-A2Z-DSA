
### ✅ What is a **Subsequence** of an Array?

A **subsequence** is a sequence that can be **derived from an array** by deleting **zero or more elements**, **without changing the order** of the remaining elements.

---

### 📌 Key Points:

* **Order must be maintained**.
* **Elements don’t need to be contiguous**.
* You can **skip elements**, but not **rearrange** them.

---

### 📘 Example:

Given array:

```js
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

**Valid subsequences**:

* `[1, 2, 3]`
* `[2, 4]`
* `[1, 4]`
* `[1, 3]`
* `[1]`
* `[]` (empty array is always a subsequence)

**Invalid subsequences**:

* `[3, 2]` ❌ (wrong order)
* `[4, 1]` ❌ (wrong order)

### 🔁 Total Number of Subsequences:

For an array of length `n`, the total number of subsequences is:

```js
2^n
```

So, for `[1, 2, 3]`, there are `2^3 = 8` subsequences:

```js
[], [1], [2], [3], [1,2], [1,3], [2,3], [1,2,3]
```

---

### ✅ In JavaScript – generate all subsequences (recursively):

```javascript
function getAllSubsequences(arr) {
    let result = [];

    function helper(index, current) {
        if (index === arr.length) {
            result.push([...current]);
            return;
        }

        // Include current element
        current.push(arr[index]);
        helper(index + 1, current);

        // Exclude current element
        current.pop();
        helper(index + 1, current);
    }

    helper(0, []);
    return result;
}

console.log(getAllSubsequences([1, 2, 3]));
```

Let me know if you want:

* Difference between **subsequence** and **substring**
* Code for **substrings**
* Or use-case in **LeetCode problems** (like Longest Increasing Subsequence, etc.)
