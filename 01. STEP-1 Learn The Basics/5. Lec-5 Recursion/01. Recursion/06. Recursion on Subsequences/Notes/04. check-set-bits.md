
## 🔢 Bitwise Left Shift (`<<`) and Checking If a Bit is Set – JavaScript Notes

---

### 🧠 1. What is the `<<` (Left Shift) Operator?

The **left shift operator (`<<`)** shifts the binary representation of a number **to the left by a specified number of bits**.

#### ✅ Syntax:

```js
a << b
```

This shifts the bits of `a` to the left by `b` positions, **filling with 0s on the right**.

---

### ✅ Example: `1 << 4`

#### Step-by-step:

* `1` in binary:

  ```
  00000001
  ```

* Shift left by 4:

  ```
  00010000
  ```

* Result:

  ```
  2⁴ = 16
  ```

#### Final code:

```js
console.log(1 << 4); // Output: 16
```

#### 🧮 Summary Table:

| Expression | Result | Binary   |
| ---------- | ------ | -------- |
| 1 << 0     | 1      | 00000001 |
| 1 << 1     | 2      | 00000010 |
| 1 << 2     | 4      | 00000100 |
| 1 << 3     | 8      | 00001000 |
| 1 << 4     | 16     | 00010000 |

### 🧪 2. How to Check if a Specific Bit is Set?

To check whether the **k-th bit** (0-based from right) in a number `x` is set (i.e., is 1), use this formula:

```js
(x & (1 << k)) !== 0
```

---

### ✅ Example: Check if 2nd bit is set in `x = 101`

#### Code:

```js
let x = 101;
let k = 2;

if ((x & (1 << k)) !== 0) {
    console.log("Bit is SET");
} else {
    console.log("Bit is NOT set");
}
```

#### Explanation:

* `x = 101` → Binary: `1100101`
* k = 2 (from right)
* 2nd bit is `1`, so it’s **set**

#### Output:

```
Bit is SET
```

### 🔍 Bit Masking Visual:

For `x = 101` and `k = 2`:

```js
Binary of x:        01100101
Binary of 1 << 2:   00000100
-----------------------------
Bitwise AND:        00000100  → non-zero ⇒ bit is set
```

---

### 🧰 Real Use Cases of Bitwise Tricks:

* Bitmasking in competitive programming
* Permission systems (e.g., read/write/execute flags)
* Optimized algorithms (e.g., counting subsets, toggling bits)
* Checking powers of 2, flipping bits, etc.

### ✅ Summary:

| Task                        | Operator / Method      | Example Code                     |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Left shift (multiply by 2ⁿ) | `1 << n`               | `1 << 4` → `16`                  |
| Check if k-th bit is set    | `(x & (1 << k)) !== 0` | Check if 2nd bit is set in `101` |
