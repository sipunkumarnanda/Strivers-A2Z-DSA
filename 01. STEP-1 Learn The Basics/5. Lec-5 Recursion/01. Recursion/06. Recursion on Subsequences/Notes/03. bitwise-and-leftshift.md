# 🔍 JavaScript Bitwise AND (`&`) with Left Shift (`<<`)

### 🧠 Goal:

Evaluate:

```js
console.log(2 & (1 << 1));
```

---

### 🧩 Step-by-Step Explanation:

#### 1. Breakdown `1 << 1`:

```js
1 << 1
= 2
```

* Binary of `1`: `00000001`
* Shift left by 1: `00000010` → equals `2`

#### 2. So the expression becomes:

```js
console.log(2 & 2);
```

---

### 🧮 Bitwise AND (`&`) Operation:

Performs a bit-by-bit AND between two numbers.

#### Binary of 2:

```
2 → 00000010
2 → 00000010
--------------
&   00000010 → 2
```

So,

```js
2 & 2 = 2
```

---

### ✅ Final Output:

```js
console.log(2 & (1 << 1)); // Output: 2
```

---

### 🔍 Use Case:

This is often used to **check if a specific bit is set**.

#### For example:

```js
let x = 2;
let k = 1;

if ((x & (1 << k)) !== 0) {
    console.log("k-th bit is set");
} else {
    console.log("k-th bit is NOT set");
}
```

Output:

```
k-th bit is set
```

Because the 1st bit (0-based) in `2` (`10` in binary) is `1`.

| Expression | Result | Explanation                 |
| ---------- | ------ | --------------------------- |
| `1 << 0`   | `1`    | 2⁰                          |
| `1 << 1`   | `2`    | 2¹                          |
| `2 & 2`    | `2`    | Both bits `1` at same place |
| `2 & 1`    | `0`    | No common `1` bits          |
