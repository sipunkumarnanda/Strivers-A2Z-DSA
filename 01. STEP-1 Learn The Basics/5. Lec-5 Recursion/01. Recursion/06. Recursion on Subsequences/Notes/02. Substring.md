
### ✅ 1. **Subsequence**

* A **subsequence** is a sequence that can be derived by **deleting zero or more elements** (not necessarily consecutive) **without changing the order** of the remaining elements.

#### ➕ Rules:

* Elements must remain in **original order**.
* Can **skip elements**.
* **Not required** to be contiguous.

#### 🧠 Example:

```js
Original: "abcde"

Valid Subsequences:
- "ace" ✅
- "bd" ✅
- "abc" ✅
- "" (empty) ✅

Invalid:
- "eca" ❌ (wrong order)
```

### ✅ 2. **Substring**

* A **substring** is a **continuous block** of characters from the original string.

#### ➕ Rules:

* **Must be contiguous**.
* **Order matters**.

#### 🧠 Example:

```js
Original: "abcde"

Valid Substrings:
- "abc" ✅
- "bcd" ✅
- "de" ✅
- "e" ✅

Invalid:
- "ace" ❌ (not contiguous)
- "ad" ❌
```
